        <h3>La Saporita Bruschetta Tropicale</h3>
        <p>An intense flavoured lemon capers sauce on top of two slices of the finest homemade Italian baguette
          already
          feels like a time relaxing in the most scenic tropical beach.But to make it even better why not
          adding cherry tomatoes, quail eggs and red leaf lettuce with coconut yoghurt and honey mustard sauce? We did
          it and
          theresult came amazing! <br><br>La Saporita Bruschetta Tropicale is going to make you feel as if you were in
          a
          scenic tropical beach… but in heaven!

        <h3>Lo Spettacolare Risotto</h3>
        <p>Let’s start it with the traditional arborio rice sautéed with garlic, Porcini mushrooms and butter which
          instantly make us watering mouth.The second step is mixing it with banana and carrot drowned in a
          soft
          sophisticated Sauvignon Blanc.<br><br> To finish it we can’t forget to put freshly grated Grana Padano and
          some basil.<br><br>
          Ecco qui! You’ll love it!

        <h3>La deliziosa Carbonara</h3>
        <p>Slow-cooked homemade carbonara firstly simmered in a juice cashew water seasoned with black pepper, salt
          and
          basil then mixed with crispy pancetta, eggs, parmesan and pecorino cheese sound like a very peculiar way of
          cooking carbonara. <br><br>But trust us, the different combination makes what is good even better.<br><br>
          It’s hard to forget!

        <h3>Ravioli Esotici</h3>
        <p>Ravioli Esotici is an innovative house speciality. Our homemade ravioli is filled with an incredibly
          tasteful
          mix of fresh pears, apples, cherry tomatoes, Brazilian nuts, lime butter, truffle-infused olive oil and
          Grana
          Padano.<br><br> The combination is quite exotic but we guarantee that it tastes likes an unbelievable
          explosion of the best flavours in the world!

        <h3>Boccone Tiramisù</h3>
        <p>A traditional tiramisu is made with a mouthful combination of mascarpone, coffee, red wine and lady’s
          fingers. But we are not traditional, are we?! <br><br>Our Il Boccone Tiramisù includes the finest Greek
          yoghurt and a Brazilian candy called paçoca which is made out of peanuts, cornflour, sugar and salt. It’s
          definitely to die for!

        <h3>Gelato Particolare</h3>
        <p>The magnificent Il gelato particolare starts like all of the usual Italian gelatos: milk, cream, and eggs.
          But we know that we are not here for the usual, right?! <br><br>To make it as creative as we like it, this
          dessert
          has an incredible barbecue-raspberry-coffee syrup which is going to make you say “Wow! Why haven’t I thought
          of this combination before?”.
