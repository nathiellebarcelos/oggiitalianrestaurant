        <h2>The Restaurant</h2>

        <p>Oggi was born from the idea of two open-minded friends who love to taste and experience the
          newest innovations in modern gastronomy, especially when it comes to the magnificent Italian cuisine. <br>
          <br>
          From mixing the finest Italian traditions with unexpected ingredients to playing with
          different textures and seasonal flavours, we want to captivate you with our unique food creations
          delivered in the warmest way you could ever imagine.<br>
          <br>

          Our newly innovated space was designed to make you feel as if you were having an excellent dinner
          in one of the charming restaurants of the Quadrilatero d’Oro.<br>
          <br>

          Come join us for this remarkable experience!
